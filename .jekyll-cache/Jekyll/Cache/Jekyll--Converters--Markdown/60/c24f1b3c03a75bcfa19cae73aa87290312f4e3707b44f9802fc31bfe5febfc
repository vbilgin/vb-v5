I"'<p>Right now I’m focusing on learning Windows Server 2016 using <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/" target="_blank">CBTNuggets</a> and some study guides I purchased from The Humble Bundle. I’m practicing what I learn in my Home Lab environment. I haven’t decided if I’m going to take the MCSA for Server 2016 just yet.</p>

<p>I’m also looking for smaller, bite-sized projects that I can work on and showcase here, on my blog! Right now the main project is polishing this site. Learn more about how I built this site and the tools I used here.</p>
