I"€<p>My name is Victor. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I love learning and I do it whenever I can. Because Iâ€™ve made learning a constant goal of mine, Iâ€™ve amassed quite a few varied interests. These include but are not limited to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>IT (Systems Administration, Penetration Testing, Cloud Architecture, Programming)</li>
  <li>Design (Logo Design and Branding, Web Design, UI/UX)</li>
  <li>Web Development</li>
  <li>Screenwriting</li>
  <li>Poetry</li>
  <li>Podcasting</li>
  <li>Philosophy</li>
</ol>

<p>Though this blog is mostly dedicated to professional write-ups of IT and Cybersecurity related topics, it will likely expand to other ones as time goes on.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently attending WGU (Western Governors University) for their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration program. Iâ€™m also working full-time as a Service Coordinator at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/melrose-inc-mac/" target="_blank">MelroseMAC</a>, an AASP.</p>
