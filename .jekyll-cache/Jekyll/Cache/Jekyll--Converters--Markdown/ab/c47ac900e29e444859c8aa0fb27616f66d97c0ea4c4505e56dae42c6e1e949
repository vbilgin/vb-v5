<p>Why do I need a blog? Well, I don’t. But it’s nice to have. And I had my domain name collecting dust so I figured I’d use it.</p>

<p>I’ve actually tried this whole blogging thing a few times. Every time I got all set up, I found I had too much to write about. My blogs always reflected my interests. And I have <em>a lot</em> of them. So I had analysis paralysis - I couldn’t decide what to write about first so I didn’t write anything at all.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this site. What’s different? Well, for one, this blog is (for now at least) solely dedicated to IT and cybersecurity. No more avalanche of options.</p>

<p>But I haven’t answered the actual question. <em>Why</em> do I <em>need</em> a blog? Because I want to showcase the projects that I’m doing and the interesting things I’m learning. I want to show people (whether it be an IT Manager looking to hire or a random person on the Internet looking for inspiration) that I did these things and usually had fun while doing so.</p>

<h1 id="the-tools">The Tools</h1>

<h2 id="jekyll"><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></h2>
<p>I found Jekyll while looking at how people in the cybersecurity community make their blogs. Quite a few use/used Jekyll so I figured it was worth a quick read. And it definitely  was. For those that aren’t aware, Jekyll is a <strong>static site generator</strong> that creates HTML from Markdown. It is built with Ruby and uses the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid</a> templating language to process templates. Jekyll also uses <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> for styling.</p>

<p>There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to the file structure and Liquid syntax but nothing intimidating. I took some time to read through the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> put together by the Jekyll devs as well as the Liquid docs (linked above).</p>

<h2 id="butane-theme-by-alex-carpenter"><a href="https://github.com/alexcarpenter/butane-jekyll-theme" target="_blank">Butane Theme by Alex Carpenter</a></h2>
<p>I could’ve create this site from scratch. I could do a lot of things. But what if I could save time? I thought finding a simple, barebones theme that I could extend would make life easier. And it did! I picked Alex’s theme because there’s not much there. That’s a good thing. Especially for someone inexperienced with Jekyll/Liquid. His theme lends itself to forking and doesn’t have a mountain of dependencies that you have to worry about. So <strong>thank you Alex</strong>; I appreciate your work.</p>

<h2 id="github-pages"><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></h2>
<p>It’s free, simple, and I can push commits to my site just as I would to any other repo. What’s not to love? Well…</p>

<p>I will eventually switch over to hosting my site on either AWS, Azure, or GCP. I enjoy the challenge of configuring and maintaing my own web server. And I have an interest in cloud. But that’s something for the future. For now, I just wanted to spin up a site quickly and cheaply. There’s really no substitute for GitHub Pages in that sense. <em>Well, maybe <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, but that’s a topic for another time.</em></p>

<h2 id="namecheap"><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">Namecheap</a></h2>
<p>Last but not least, I needed a domain registrar for my domain (victorbilgin.com). I’ve used Namecheap in the past and they live up to their name. Some domains are <strong>dirt cheap</strong>. Even a .com won’t set you back too much. I’m paying about $9/year for this domain.</p>

<p>But don’t let their name make you think cheap is all they are. Aside from the occasional site bug, I’ve never had an issue buying, transfering, and redirecting domains using their dead-simple settings. Plus they offer free <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/whoisguard/" target="_blank">WhoisGuard</a> (their domain privacy protection service) for any and all domains registered with them.</p>

<h1 id="the-execution">The Execution</h1>
<p>This is, in my opinion, the best part of making a new personal site. I sat down and figured out what color scheme I wanted to use using <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors.co</a>. I sought out the amazing <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">fonts.google.com</a> to look for fonts that I hope you’ve enjoyed looking at.</p>

<p>Once that was all done, I copied Alex’s Butane theme to my machine, installed Jekyll, and ran a quick <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>.</p>

<p>I spent about 5-6 hours tweaking the theme until I got it how I wanted. I won’t go into all of those tweaks because none of them individually make a massive difference. But, if you compare my site with the original theme, you see a difference. That was the end goal.</p>
