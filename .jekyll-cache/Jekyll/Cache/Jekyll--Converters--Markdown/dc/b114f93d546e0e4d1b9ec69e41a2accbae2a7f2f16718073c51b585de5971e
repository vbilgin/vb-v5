I";<p>Right now I’m focusing on learning Windows Server 2016 using <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/" target="_blank">CBTNuggets</a> and some study guides I purchased from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank">The Humble Bundle</a>. I’m practicing what I learn in my labbing environment. I haven’t decided if I’m going to actually take the MCSA exams for Server 2016. But I probably will.</p>

<p>I’m also looking for smaller, bite-sized projects that I can work on and showcase here, on my blog! Right now the main project is polishing this site.</p>
