<p>Why do I need a blog? Well, I don’t. But it’s nice to have. And I had my domain name collecting dust so I figured I’d use it.</p>

<p>I’ve actually tried this whole blogging thing a few times. Every time I got all set up, I found I had too much to write about. My blogs always reflected my interests. And I have <em>a lot</em> of them. So I had analysis paralysis - I couldn’t decide what to write about first so I didn’t write anything at all.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this site. What’s different? Well, for one, this blog is (for now at least) solely dedicated to IT and cybersecurity. No more avalanche of options.</p>

<p>But I haven’t answered the actual question. <em>Why</em> do I <em>need</em> a blog? Because I want to showcase the projects that I’m doing and the interesting things I’m learning. I want to show people (whether it be an IT Manager looking to hire or a random person on the Internet looking for inspiration) that I did these things and usually had fun while doing so.</p>

<p>I found Jekyll while looking at how people in the cybersecurity community make their blogs. Quite a few use/used Jekyll so I figured it was worth a quick read. And it definitely  was. For those that aren’t aware, Jekyll is a <strong>static site generator</strong> that creates HTML from Markdown. It is built with Ruby and uses the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid</a> templating language to process templates. Jekyll also uses <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> for styling.</p>

<p>There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to the file structure and Liquid syntax but nothing intimidating. I took some time to read through the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> as well as</p>
