My name is Victor. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I love learning and I do it whenever I can. Because I've made learning a constant goal of mine, I've amassed quite a few varied interests. These include but are not limited to:

1. IT (Systems Administration, Penetration Testing, Cloud Architecture, Programming)
2. Design (Logo Design and Branding, Web Design, UI/UX)
3. Web Development
4. Screenwriting
5. Poetry
6. Podcasting
7. Philosophy

Though this blog is mostly dedicated to professional write-ups of IT and Cybersecurity related topics, it will likely expand to other ones as time goes on.

I'm currently attending WGU (Western Governors University) for their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration program. I'm also working full-time as a Service Coordinator at [MelroseMAC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/melrose-inc-mac/){:target="_blank"}, an AASP.
