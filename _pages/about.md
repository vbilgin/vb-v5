Hey! My name's Victor and this is my site. It's simple, fast, and serves as my corner of the Internet. Feel free to explore and don't hesitate to email me (link below) if you find any mistakes or issues.

I was born in Los Angeles, CA and have lived here all my life. Right now my focus is IT and I'm working as a Help Desk Specialist while going to school full-time to get a BS in Cloud and Systems Admin (more about what I'm doing now can be found on my [now page](now.md)).

If you talk to someone that knows me, they'll likely tell you I have a lot of interests. That's true; my list of interests is long and often scary to look at. But I try to maintain focus on a few key areas where I feel I can have the biggest impact. I'm in the learning stage currently &mdash; this involves consuming as much information as possible about those key areas of interest. What are those areas? They include 
- IT (mostly general infrastructure, cloud, and offensive security)
- Web Development
- Graphic Design

Eventually I'll hit the production stage where I'll be trying to produce resources for others and, hopefully, products and services that improve society. If you're interested in any of the above (or even something tangential), feel free to shoot me an email.
