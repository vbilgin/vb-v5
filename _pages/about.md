There's only one thing you should know about me: **I love to learn**. But, if you'd like to know more:

- I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA where I currently live.
- I have a lot of interests. But right now I'm focused on IT (with a sub-focus on InfoSec).
- I'm currently attending [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/){:target="_blank"} for their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration program. 
- I'm also working full-time as a Service Coordinator at [MelroseMAC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/melrose-inc-mac/){:target="_blank"}, an AASP.
- My current goal is to land an entry to mid-level IT role.
