I love learning new things.

- I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA where I currently live.
- I have a lot of interests. But right now I'm focused on IT (with a sub-focus on information security).
- I'm currently attending [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) for their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration program. 
- I'm also working full-time as a Help Desk Specialist at [Houlihan Lokey](https://www.hl.com/), a global M&A leader.
