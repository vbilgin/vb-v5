Hey! I'm assuming that since you're here you want to know a bit more about me. I'm fascinated by the world and the people in it. I love learning how things work and seeing if they can work better. But I get distracted easily. Before I know it, I'm off to the next thing, reading a book on this or a Wikipedia article on that. I have a lot of interests. I don't mean to showboat. I'm just a jack of all trades. But how can one not be? There's so much out there to explore and see. I know I won't learn about it all - no one can. But I can sure as hell try.

This site serves a lot of purposes. It acts as my corner of the internet where I can showcase things I've been working on, sell myself as a possible employee, and document my research and thoughts. It also gives me an avenue to express my creativity in terms of design and the written word.  

If you want to reach out and talk about something you've seen here or just want to chat, please don't hesitate to email me (link below).
