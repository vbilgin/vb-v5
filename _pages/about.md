If you couldn't guess by now, my name is Victor. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA where I currently live. If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I **love** to learn.

I'm currently attending WGU (Western Governors University) for their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration program. I'm also working full-time as a Service Coordinator at [MelroseMAC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/melrose-inc-mac/){:target="_blank"}, an AASP.
