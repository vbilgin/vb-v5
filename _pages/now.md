Right now I'm focusing on school. When I have time to kill or I finish a class faster than expected, I shift my attention to web app pentesting and bug bounty hunting. I'm reading the famous [*The Web Application Hackers Handbook*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118026470/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_AhARDbPSJZ61Y){:target="_blank"} by Dayydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto to get an introduction. For the practical side, I'm trying my hand at actual bounty programs on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Bug Crowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm also looking for smaller, bite-sized projects that I can work on and showcase here, on my blog! Right now the main project is polishing this site.
