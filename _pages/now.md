I'm back to learning Italian. It's a beautiful language with a rhythm in the speech that's unmatched.

Work is going well. I'm learning about the infrastructure and progressing. Working from home makes this more difficult as a new hire but I'm making the most of it. Thankfully I have wonderful colleagues.
