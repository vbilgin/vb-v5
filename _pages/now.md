## School
Still attending [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) and pursuing their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration degree. Set to graduate in mid-2021.

## Work
Started a new job in March 2020 working as a Help Desk Specialist for [Houlihan Lokey](https://hl.com/), a global investment bank.

Work is going well. I'm learning about the infrastructure and progressing. Working from home makes this more difficult as a new hire but I'm making the most of it. Thankfully I have wonderful colleagues.
