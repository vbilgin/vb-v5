I'm back to learning Italian. It's a beautiful language with a rhythm in the speech that's unmatched.

I'm also trying to learn Python for the umteenth time. It's not a difficult language to learn (at least at the beginner to intermediate level) but I've always gotten side-tracked. Maybe that'll happen this time as well but I'm hopeful. I'm also trying to learn more intermediate programming concepts.

Work is going well. I'm learning about the infrastructure and progressing. Working from home makes this more difficult as a new hire but I'm making the most of it. Thankfully I have wonderful colleagues.
