I'm sheltering in place like (hopefully) most of the people in the US, Europe, and Asia. I'm thankful to be able to work from home. And it gives me a chance to get situated in my new role.

I'm also trying to get back in shape. Small steps. Smaller portion sizes here, 30 minute stationary bike ride there.

And who can forget about side projects? You might see a post about one soon enough.
