Right now I'm focusing on learning Windows Server 2016 using [CBTNuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/){:target="_blank"} and some study guides I purchased from [The Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/){:target="_blank"}. I'm practicing what I learn in my labbing environment. I haven't decided if I'm going to actually take the MCSA exams for Server 2016. But I probably will.

I'm also looking for smaller, bite-sized projects that I can work on and showcase here, on my blog! Right now the main project is polishing this site.
