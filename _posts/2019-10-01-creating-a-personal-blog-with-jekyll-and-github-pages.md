# The Purpose
Why do I need a blog? Well, I don't. But it's nice to have. And I had my domain name collecting dust so I figured I'd use it.

I've actually tried this whole blogging thing a few times. Every time I got all set up, I found I had too much to write about. My blogs always reflected my interests. And I have *a lot* of them. So I had analysis paralysis - I couldn't decide what to write about first so I didn't write anything at all. 

Which brings me to this site. What's different? Well, for one, this blog is (for now at least) solely dedicated to IT and cybersecurity. No more avalanche of options. 

But I haven't answered the actual question. *Why* do I *need* a blog? Because I want to showcase the projects that I'm doing and the interesting things I'm learning. I want to show people (whether it be an IT Manager looking to hire or a random person on the Internet looking for inspiration) that I did these things and usually had fun while doing so.

# The Tools

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}
I found Jekyll while looking at how people in the cybersecurity community make their blogs. Quite a few use/used Jekyll so I figured it was worth a quick read. And it definitely  was. For those that aren't aware, Jekyll is a **static site generator** that creates HTML from Markdown. It is built with Ruby and uses the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/){:target="_blank"} templating language to process templates. Jekyll also uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/){:target="_blank"} for styling.

There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to the file structure and Liquid syntax but nothing intimidating. I took some time to read through the [step-by-step guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/){:target="_blank"} as well as
