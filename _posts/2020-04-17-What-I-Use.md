title: What I Use
---

I've always found it interesting to see what people use to get their work done. So here's my (non-exhaustive) setup:

# Hardware
My main computer is a desktop PC that I built in the beginning of 2019. I didn't plan it very well because I was eager to get going. Thankfully everything is modular (one of the joys of building your own computer) so adding and removing parts is a breeze. [Here is the PCPartPicker list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TtwvYH) for those interested. Below are the main specs:

- Intel Core i5-8400 2.8 GHz 6-core
- 16GB DDR4-2400 Corsair Vengeance RAM (2x8GB)
- Zotac GTX 1080 8GB Mini
- Phanteks Enthoo Pro M TG Mid Tower Case

It's not a pretty build but it works and has served me well for more than a year. But given the amazing strides AMD has made with their consumer CPUs, I'm tempted to cannibalize this build and put together an AMD-focused ITX build. I have to remind myself often that "there's nothing wrong with the specs I have." It's an uphill battle. I think everyone with an expensive hobby can relate.

I also have a 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro that has no backlight. It sits behind my display in a vertical laptop stand and collects dust most of the time. Fixing is out of the question since a connector on the logic board is the cause. Yes, I know I *could* fix it but neither soldering nor buying a replacement board are worth it for a 2015 in my opinion. I'll occasionally power it on to mess with a new version of macOS or if I need to use a macOS-only app.

## Peripherals
My display is a [34-inch LG Ultrawide](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34WK650-W-ultrawide-monitor) supported by an [AmazonBasics Monitor Arm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MIBN16O/). The LG Ultrawide is fantastic for the price. I've always been a two display guy but this thing made be reconsider. I still prefer two displays and am saving up for decent 4K 27-inch panel but hey, at least I gave the whole "single ultrawide" thing a chance. The Amazon arm is so good I'll be buying another one once I have that second monitor. The only nit-pick I have is that the base is pretty large compared to pricier arms out there. Certainly not a deal breaker.

My current keyboard is a [Ducky One 2 Mini](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4322). It's a fine board. I have to agree with most people when they say that Ducky keyboards are great but overpriced for what they are. I got mine with MX Browns, which are objectively the best switches... just joking. Although I do have a [Deck Francium Pro](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3701) with MX Reds and I don't like them anywhere near as much.

My mouse is the beloved [Logitech G502](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019OB663A/). It's a wonderful mouse and the ability to change the weight is a great addition at the price point. I'll usually use this in combination with a [Logitech MX Master 2S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071YZJ1G1/). The former is used for gaming and general browsing while the latter is used for work.

# Software
I have two Samsung 860 EVO SSDs in my main PC, a 1TB and a 500GB. The 1TB is loaded with Windows 10. The 500GB is loaded with ~~[Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop)~~ (I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 but will switch back to Pop!_OS once the System76 team updates it to 20.04). Given that my current company almost exclusively uses Windows for both infrastructure and user systems, I find myself using Windows more than any other OS. I'll be honest here: I like Windows. I feel comfortable in it. But, that being said, I'm a sucker for a cool Linux distro. Pop!_OS is not a cool distro per say but it sure is fun to use. It's what Ubuntu should be, in my opinion.

## Favorite Apps
While I do find myself using web-based applications for most things today, there are some amazing desktop apps I have to mention.
1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My editor of choice for anything from my personal wiki all the way to complex scripts and web development. Fast (yes, I know it's built on Electron but it's build well), extensible, open source. I've realized that having a favorite editor is like having a favorite color: it's incredibly subjective. I don't care what editor you use, just use what's best for you!
2. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - My browser of choice on Windows and Linux. The sad truth is that Firefox is the last stand against Chrome and Chromium-based browsers. I like competition and I've used Firefox forever so I'm sticking with it until the bloody end.
3. [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Do you hate the default image viewer in Windows 10? Yeah, me too. This is a fully-featured and fast replacement.
4. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - What more can I say? If you want to learn something and I mean **learn** it, then get Anki and use it daily. [Here is a short tutorial by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo) on how to use it effectively.
5. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) - If you're not using a music-streaming service by now you're probably not going to. I'm a huge fan of self-hosting but the fact that I can pay $4.99/month (student discounts are a wonderful thing) and have access to millions of songs anywhere is amazing. Maybe one day I'll finally self-host my music like I do for movies and TV but that day is not soon.
6. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - This thing will play anything. If VLC can't play the file then maybe it's not worth playing? It has its quirks and faults but then again most software does. It's one of the first apps I install on any fresh system.

There you have it. That's the bulk of what I use to do what I do. I might do a post in the future on my phone and mobile apps but there's nothing too interesting there for now. I'll also keep this post updated as things change. Want to argue about editors or one vs. two display setups? Shoot me an email (link below)!
