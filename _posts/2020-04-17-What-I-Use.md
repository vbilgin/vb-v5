title: What I Use
---
*This post is in the draft stage. It is unfinished and there could be mistakes.*

I've always found it interesting to see what people use to get their work done. So here's my (non-exhaustive) list:

# Hardware
My main computer is a custom-built PC that I build in the beginning of 2019. I didn't plan it well because I wanted to get it built quickly. Thankfully everything is modular so adding and removing parts is a breeze. [Here is the PCPartPicker list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TtwvYH) for those interested. Below are the main specs:

- Intel Core i5-8400 2.8 GHz 6-core
- 16GB DDR4-2400 Corsair Vengeance RAM
- Zotac GTX 1080 8GB Mini
- Phanteks Enthoo Pro M TG Mid Tower Case

It's not a pretty build but it works and has served me well for more than a year. But given, the amazing strides AMD has made with their consumer CPUs, I'm tempted to canabilize this build and put together an AMD-focused ITX build. I have to remind myself often that "there's nothing wrong with the specs I have." It's an uphill battle.

I also have a 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro that has no backlight. It sits behind my display in a vertical laptop stand and collects dust most of the time. The issue is with the logic board so fixing is out of the question sadly. I'll occasionally power it on to mess with a new version of macOS or if I need to use a Mac-only app.

## Peripherals
My display is a [34-inch LG Ultrawide](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34WK650-W-ultrawide-monitor) supported by an [AmazonBasics Monitor Arm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MIBN16O/). The LG Ultrawide is fantastic for the price. I've always been a two display guy but this thing made be reconsider. I still prefer two displays and am saving up for decent 4K 27-inch panel but hey, at least I gave the whole "single ultrawide" thing a chance. The Amazon arm is so good I'll be buying another one once I have that second monitor. The only nit-pick I have is that the base is pretty large compared to pricier arms out there. Certainly not a deal breaker.

My current keyboard is a [Ducky One 2 Mini](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4322). It's a fine board. I have to agree with most people when they say that Ducky keyboard are great but overpriced for what they are. I got mine with MX Browns, which are objectively the best switches... just joking. Although I do have a [Deck Francium Pro](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3701) with MX Reds and I don't like them anywhere near as much.

My mouse is a the beloved [Logitech G502](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019OB663A/). It's a wonderful mouse and the ability to change the weight is a great addition at the price point. I'll usually use this in combination with a [Logitech MX Master 2S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071YZJ1G1/). The former is used for gaming and general use while the latter is used for work.

# Software
I have two Samsung 860 EVO SSDs in my main PC. The 1TB is loaded with Windows 10. The 500GB is loaded with [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop). Given that my current company almost exclusively uses Windows for both back-end and user systems, I find myself using Windows more than any other OS. I'll be honest here: I like Windows. I feel comfortable in it. But, that being said, I'm a sucker for a cool Linux distro. Pop!_OS is not a cool distro per say but it sure is fun to use. It's what Ubuntu should be, in my opinion. I can't wait to upgrade to 20.04 after System 76 has a look at it.

## Favorite Apps
While I do find myself using web-based applications for most things today, there are some amazing apps I have to mention.
1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My editor of choice for anything from my personal wiki all the way to complex scripts and web development. Fast (yes, I know it's built on Electron but it's build well), extensible, open source. What more could you need?
2. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - My browser of choice on Windows and Linux. The sad truth is that Firefox is the last stand against Chrome and Chromium-based browsers. I like competition and I've used Firefox forever so I'm sticking with until the bloody end.
3. [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) - Do you hate the default image viewer in Windows 10? Yeah, me too. This is a fully-featured and fast replacement.
4. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - What more can I say? If you want to learn something and I mean **learn** it, then get Anki and use it daily.
5. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) - If you're not using a music-streaming service by now you're probably not going to. I'm a huge fan of self-hosting but the fact that I can pay $4.99/month (student discounts are a wonderful thing) and have access to millions of songs is amazing.
6. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - This thing will play anything. If VLC can't play the file then maybe it's not worth playing? It has its quirks and faults but then again most software does.
