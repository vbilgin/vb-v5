I'm **Victor**, an aspiring IT professional. This is my personal site. I treat it like my little corner of the Internet. Sometimes you'll see a blog post or two. Other times you might find a new project being showcased. And still other times you may find nothing at all. Go ahead and explore! 

*See you on the other side.*

# What I'm doing now ↓
I'm sheltering in place like (hopefully) most of the people in the US, Europe, and Asia. I'm thankful to be able to work from home. And it gives me a chance to get situated in my new role.

I'm also trying to get back in shape. Small steps. Smaller portion sizes here, 30 minute stationary bike ride there.

And who can forget about side projects? You might see a post about one soon enough.

# About me ↓
There's only one thing you should know about me: **I love to learn**. But, if you'd like to know more:

- I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA where I currently live.
- I have a lot of interests. But right now I'm focused on IT (with a sub-focus on information security).
- I'm currently attending [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/){:target="_blank"} for their BS in Cloud and Systems Administration program. 
- I'm also working full-time as a Help Desk Specialist at [Houlihan Lokey](https://www.hl.com/){:target="_blank"}, a global M&A leader.
